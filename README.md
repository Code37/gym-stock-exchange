# Gym-Stock-Exchange

Implementing a `stock-exchange` environment in `OPEN-AI`'s [gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment.
There exists two version, one for `discrete` action space, and the other for `continuous`.

### Getting Started
To get started, youâ€™ll need to have `Python 3.5+` installed. 
Simply install `gym` using pip:
```
pip install gym
```

Once `gym` is installed, clone this repository, then run 
```
python3 demo_exchange.py
```

### Tensorflow
If you want to integrate `reinforcement learning agents`, I recommend using
[baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines/), or [stable baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines). These are based on `tensorflow`.

### Fan of `PyTorch`?
If you're a fan of `pytorch`, [stock-exchange-pytorch](https://github.com/wbaik/stock-exchange-pytorch) supports implementations for `reinforcement learning` and `supervised learning`. This repository is actually an offshoot of that project.

### Examples of Reinforcement Learnings
With a `random agent`, an output of `demo_stock_exchange.py` is like so:

With `stable-baselines`, `Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)` is used in the `demo_exchange.py` to train the model. An output of such is like so:
